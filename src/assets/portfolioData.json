    "bio":"I've always been interested in anything creative, whether it involved drawing comics, writing, photography, or charcoal sketching. I was ecstatic to discover UX Design, which seemed like a perfect blend of creativity and technology. Soon, I became interested in learning more about how the technology worked and immersed myself in the world of web development. I found that coding agreed a lot with the analytical side of my mind that made me a great researcher, and continued my journey into development.",

He is a thoughtful and collaborative communicator both with the Instructional Staff and within his various groups. His affinity for project planning, attention to detail and natural design talent have contributed to his success as a developer. Ryan helped to lead the ideation and implementation of his group projects. His background in UX/UI is a unique and advantageous skill which helped him to build advanced applications. Ryan was able to thoroughly scope each of his project, from front-end design to back-end logic, anticipating specific user interactions and potential roadblocks. He and his groups were successful in the deployment of their applications and have plans to build out additional features and optimize their previous logic. Ryan will be a fantastic member of any team and I look forward to watching him grow as a developer!",

I first want to mention that Ryan demonstrated a work ethic, passion, and drive that was above and beyond our expectations. As a result, his final project was not only one of the strongest I have seen during my time at Jefferson but also one that garnished continued interest after he graduated. Ryan has a real strength for analytical thinking, design strategy, and problem definition â€“ he would best be utilized in a space where he can put those abilities to the task. I highly recommend Ryan and believe he would be a tremendous value to any design team in the innovation space.",
